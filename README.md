# What are the my Wordle rules?

* To submit a guess, type any five-letter word and press enter.
* You have to guess the Wordle "Word" in six times or less
* All of your guesses must be real words & must be in the word list. (There are  12,971 words in this list.)
* A correct letter in right position **turns green**
* A correct letter in the wrong position **turns yellow**
* An incorrect letter **turns gray**
* Letters can be used more than once
* Answers are never plurals
* You must be type five-letter
* Six-times missed, It's Game over
* You can try again as much as you want to restart
